in the 4.py we use form

in the conditional statement 

if mathod == 'post':
    usr = request.form['name']

else:
    reutrn render...('login.html')

this means that when we refresh the page it will be refreshed as get method and when we type some text and submit it 

it will be refreshed as a 'post' refresh 

then we use the information in the post refresh which is the name of the user
